Welcome! I am an Engineering Student specializing in **Core Computing (C/C++)** and **Data Analysis** at Polytech Lille (Class of 2026). This portfolio showcases my hands-on application of complex algorithms, efficient data structures, and fundamental software engineering principles.

My focus is on robust, system-level programming and leveraging data fundamentals to solve challenging problems.

## üìú Project Deep Dive: Dinic Algorithm Implementation

This was a major project combining structures and algorithms, resulting in a robust implementation with a final grade of **16/20**.

### üéØ Goal
To study, analyze, and implement the high-performance **DINIC Algorithm** in **C** for calculating the maximum flow in a network.

### üí° Core Design Choices
The project required a detailed analysis of data structures [cite: 210, 684][cite_start], leading to the final choice: a **Linked List of Successors** with **Pointers to Reverse Arcs**.

| Structure Chosen | Justification | Complexity |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Linked List of Successors** | [cite_start]Optimal memory usage [cite: 303] (proportional to arcs) [cite_start][cite: 243][cite_start], fast access to successors ($O(d^+(s))$) [cite: 258][cite_start], and excellent flexibility for dynamic addition/deletion of arcs[cite: 284]. | [cite_start]$O(n+m)$ (Memory) [cite: 227] |
| **Pointers to Inverse Arcs** | [cite_start]Essential for modeling the **residual graph** (graphe d'√©cart)[cite: 295, 298]. [cite_start]This allows for fast, $O(1)$ update of capacities and flow reversals without searching the successor list[cite: 296, 299]. | [cite_start]$O(1)$ (Flow Update) [cite: 299] |

### üìà Results & Validation
The program successfully calculated the maximum flow on complex test cases:

* **R√©seau R1 (`net1.txt`):** Flot maximal **40** (Manual verification successful).
* **R√©seau R2 (`net2.txt`):** Flot maximal **15** (Manual verification successful).
* **Large-Scale Test (`G_2500_7500.max`):** Successfully managed a graph with **2500 vertices and 7500 arcs**, confirming robustness and controlled memory consumption.

## üíª Project Deep Dive: Flood It Game (Web Development)

This project focused on implementing game logic and front-end interaction using web technologies.

### üéÆ Goal
To develop a fully functional, browser-based version of the "Flood It" puzzle game, allowing users to customize grid size, color count, and play in a **Challenge Mode** with limited moves.

### üí° Key Skills & Features

* **Recursive Flood Fill:** Used a recursive function (`remplir`) to implement the core game mechanic of propagating the selected color to adjacent cells of the same color.
* **DOM Manipulation:** Dynamic generation of the game grid and color palette based on user configuration inputs.
* **UI/UX:** Utilized **Bootstrap** for responsive layout and clean presentation, including a configuration page and an integrated tutorial.
* **Game State Management:** Tracking the number of moves and checking the victory/loss condition in real-time.
