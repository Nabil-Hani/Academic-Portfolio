I am an Engineering Student specializing in Core Computing (C/C++) and Data Analysis at Polytech Lille (Class of 2026). This portfolio showcases my hands-on application of complex algorithms, efficient data structures, and fundamental software engineering principles.My focus is on robust, system-level programming and leveraging data fundamentals to solve challenging problems.üõ†Ô∏è Core Technical ExpertiseDomainKey Technologies & ConceptsLow-Level & AlgorithmsC (Mastery), Data Structures (Lists, Queues), Dynamic Memory Allocation (malloc/free), Unix System Calls, Makefiles.Databases & BISQL (Queries & Schema Design), Data Aggregation, KPI Logic, Conceptual experience with Qlik Sense.Web DevelopmentHTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (DOM Manipulation), Responsive Design (Bootstrap).Core EngineeringC++, Java (OOP Fundamentals), Algorithmic Complexity ($O(n+m)$ analysis), Problem Solving.üöÄ Featured Academic ProjectsThis curated selection of projects highlights my ability to transition from theoretical analysis to rigorous, working code.

This allows for fast, $O(1)$ update of capacities and flow reversals without searching the successor list. 8888888$O(1)$ (Flow Update) 9üìà Results & ValidationThe program successfully calculated the maximum flow on complex test cases:R√©seau R1 (net1.txt): Flot maximal 40 (Manual verification successful). 10101010R√©seau R2 (net2.txt): Flot maximal 15 (Manual verification successful). 11111111Large-Scale Test (G_2500_7500.max): Successfully managed a graph with 2500 vertices and 7500 arcs, confirming robustness and controlled memory consumption. 12121212üíª Project Deep Dive: Flood It Game (Web Development)This project focused on implementing game logic and front-end interaction using web technologies.üéÆ GoalTo develop a fully functional, browser-based version of the "Flood It" puzzle game, allowing users to customize grid size, color count, and play in a Challenge Mode with limited moves. 13üí° Key Skills & FeaturesRecursive Flood Fill: Used a recursive function (remplir) to implement the core game mechanic of propagating the selected color to adjacent cells of the same color. 14DOM Manipulation: Dynamic generation of the game grid and color palette based on user configuration inputs. 15UI/UX: Utilized Bootstrap for responsive layout and clean presentation, including a configuration page and an integrated tutorial. 16Game State Management: Tracking the number of moves and checking the victory/loss condition in real-time. 17üì¨ Let's ConnectCurrently actively seeking a 10-week minimum internship in France (Lille preferred) or abroad between April and August 2026. I am eager to apply my skills in core development and technical analysis to a challenging industry role.üîó [Your LinkedIn Profile]([Your URL])üìß nabil.hani@polytech-lille.net | nabil04hani@gmail.comüèÜ Certifications: C2 English Proficiency (CPE) and TOEIC (Score: 985/990).üìú LicenseAll code and documentation in this academic portfolio are licensed under the MIT License.
